# Geo-Net

[GeoNet API](https://api.geonet.org.nz/)

## Installation
To install everything needed for this project you need to have a version of Node JS and NPM installed on your machine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/19WDWU02/Geo-Net.git
$ cd Geo-Net
$ npm install
```

## Task
You are to use the GeoNet api to create an application which showcases any type of data which you can get from their API.  
Look through all the different endpoints to see what data you can retrieve.  
You don't need to create a 'pretty' front-end interface for it at this stage, but rather just get the data and then view it on the screen in an appropriate way.  
ie. If you only get Lat & Lng values, then an appropriate way would be to view it on a map rather than just a list of coordinates
